          <p>The word 'data' is used to describe a collection of facts or figures.</p>
          <p>We collect a lot of facts and figures in government - prices, weights, addresses, ages, names, temperatures, dates, distances.</p>
          <p>When we organise, analyse and interpret this data it can help us develop a clear picture of a situation. We can then use it to make more accurate, informed decisions.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <p>The survey should take 5 minutes to complete. There are {{number_questions}} questions.</p>
      <p>At the end of the survey you will be given a learning level and directed towards learning resources.</p>

      <p>Your answers will provide the One Big Thing team with valuable data that will be used to evaluation One Big Thing. Your answers will also be used to help shape future learning and development for civil servants.</p>
